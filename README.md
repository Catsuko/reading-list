# Reading List

Here is a collection of great blogs from programmers I find myself coming back to. The goal is to keep reference to them either for myself or to share with others! I'll only include personal blogs since the style of the author as a person and a programmer is one of the main reasons I hold these blogs in high regard.

## Blogs

[Steve Yegge](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/home)
Steve is an ex-Amazon, ex-Google engineer with a huge archive, his signature writing style is polemic and strongly opinionated which I think makes for great reading. While Steve is obviously a very smart guy, this style avoids feeling preachy or snobby since he mixes in a lot of self deprecating humour. I find his blog a great source of motivation to become better as a developer!
