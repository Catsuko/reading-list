# Programmer Reading List

Here is a collection of great blogs from programmers I find myself coming back to. The goal is to keep reference to them either for myself or to share with others! I'll only include personal blogs since the style of the author as a person and a programmer is one of the main reasons I hold these blogs in high regard. Additionally I'll include a single article from each that I think will serve as a good entry point to their style and content.

## Blogs

There is no ranking to the following list of authors, the order is based on whatever came to my mind first at the time of writing.

### [Steve Yegge](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/home)
Steve is an ex-Amazon, ex-Google engineer with a huge archive, his signature writing style is polemic, strongly opinionated and rant-y which I think makes for great reading. While Steve is obviously a very smart guy, this style avoids feeling preachy or snobby since he mixes in a lot of self deprecating humour. He covers a huge range of topics but my favourite are his posts on self improvement as a developer.

### [Yegor Bugayenko](https://www.yegor256.com/)
Yegor is an engineer, writer and speaker whose blog covers topics such as OOP, open source and engineering management. His blog posts are concise, straight to the point and blunt and I think at their best when he is writing about OOP. I would describe his views as extremist which I think is the main appeal of the blog, following his ideals and seeing how it manifests as a very unique coding style is very fun and refreshing. This aspect of the blog also leads to a great comments section where every article contains lots of heated discussions.

### [Vaidehi Joshi](https://medium.com/basecs)
To take a break from being beaten over the head with the aggressive opinions of the previous two, the next programmer in my list runs an incredibly informative and fun blog on Computer Science. My favourite thing about Vaidehi, is she takes topics that would put me straight to sleep on Wikipedia and explains them in a way that is easy to understand but also engaging. Furthermore her content has THE best accompanying images I've ever seen, each article will be abundant with gorgeously drawn bullet journal style diagrams.

### [Marc Brooker](https://brooker.co.za/blog/)
Marc is an Amazon engineer who has worked on such titan products as EC2 & DynamoDB, the focus of his blog is on distributed systems and related problems. The main thing I enjoy here is he takes very complicated topics and presents them in an accessible and well written way that is also engaging, which I think is an impressive feat given how far above me it feels like a lot of the problems and solutions are. I particularly like when he will take a classic problem in distributed systems and demonstrate it using some fictional scenario or short story.

### [Carlo Pescio](http://www.carlopescio.com/)
Carlo is an engineer whose blog is no longer active anymore but is filled with interesting articles. He mainly covers code design, namely OOP, often in a very formal approach but with a witty and snarky writing style that makes the content enjoyable to follow and interact with. For me, the appeal of his blog is he offers a lot of thought provoking challenges and criticisms on what you may consider conventional OOP practice, which similar to Yegor I think is very refreshing to read.
